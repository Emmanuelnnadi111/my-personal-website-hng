        <h2>Tech Goals for the Next 2 Years</h2>
        <p>
          My goal for the next two years is to become proficient in both
          fullstack web development and mobile app development. I aim to master
          front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with
          popular frameworks like React and Vue.js for building responsive and
          dynamic web applications. Simultaneously, I plan to delve into
          back-end technologies such as Node.js and databases like MongoDB to
          create robust server-side solutions. On the mobile development front,
          I aspire to become skilled in developing native applications for both
          Android and iOS platforms using technologies like Kotlin/Java for
          Android and Swift for iOS. Additionally, I intend to explore
          cross-platform frameworks such as React Native or Flutter to
          efficiently build and deploy mobile apps across multiple platforms. By
          the end of these two years, I aim to have a strong portfolio
          showcasing my expertise in both fullstack web development and mobile
          app development, ready to pursue exciting opportunities in the tech
          industry."
